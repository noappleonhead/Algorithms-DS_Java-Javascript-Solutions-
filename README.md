# Algorithms-DS_Java-JavaScript-Solutions-

This repository contains my solutions and some best solutions I found online for some common algorithms&Ds questions written in Java and JavaScripts.

The reason for set up this project: as a Front end developer, especially not coming from a CS background, I am keen to learn algorithms and data structures and building a solid computer science problem solving skills. Hope this repo can help someone like myself or anyone keen to start learning algo&DS. Contribution&PR is welcome! 

Every solution is tested and some of them contains more than 1 solution with different approachs. Here are some guides to test these solutions:

1. All Java solutions are tested on either Leetcode/Lintcode, so I suggest directly test Java solution in Leetcode/Lintcode IDE, the reference number to Lintcode is attached at the beginning of each file. 
2. For Javascript solutions, some of these have been resloved using TDD. You can check the solution by directly fork&clone this repo and exectuing test inside tests directory.

Testing dependency:
* Step1: Install jest => "npm i -g jest"
* Step2: for instance, test fizzbuzz solution, run command "jest fizzbuzz/test.js --watch"
